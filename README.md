## See it run (60 seconds)

```bash
pip install kohakuterrarium                                         # install
kt login codex                                                      # authenticate
kt install https://github.com/Kohaku-Lab/kt-biome.git            # get OOTB creatures
kt run @kt-biome/creatures/swe --mode cli                        # run one
```

You get an interactive shell with a full coding agent — file tools, shell access, web search, sub-agents, resumable sessions. `Ctrl+D` exits; `kt resume --last` picks back up.

## Is this for you?

**You probably want KohakuTerrarium if** you need a new agent shape and don't want to rebuild the substrate; you want OOTB creatures you can customise; you want to embed agent behaviour in existing Python; your requirements are still evolving.

**You probably don't if** an existing agent product (Claude Code, Codex, …) already fits your stable needs; your mental model doesn't map onto controller / tools / triggers / sub-agents / channels; you need sub-50 ms per-operation latency. More honesty at [boundaries](docs/en/concepts/boundaries.md).

## What KohakuTerrarium is

KohakuTerrarium is a framework for building agents — not another agent.

The last two years produced a striking number of agent products: Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Gemini CLI, Hermes Agent, OpenCode, and many more. They are genuinely different, and they all re-implement the same substrate from scratch: a controller loop, tool dispatch, trigger system, sub-agent mechanism, sessions, persistence, multi-agent wiring. Every new agent shape costs a new ground-up reimplementation of the plumbing.

KohakuTerrarium's job is to put that substrate in one place so the next agent shape costs a config file and a few custom modules, not a new repo.

The core abstraction is the **creature**: a standalone agent with its own controller, tools, sub-agents, triggers, memory, and I/O. Creatures are hosted by a **Terrarium** engine: a graph runtime for channels, lifecycle, output wiring, hot-plug, and the topology + session bookkeeping that follows graph changes. A **Studio** layer sits above that for catalog, identity, active sessions, persistence, live traces, and web/desktop/API management. Optionally, a **Laboratory** transport layer can split host and engine across machines — Studio + Terrarium stay unchanged, with a WebSocket-based network hop slotted in between. Everything is Python, so agents can be embedded inside tools, triggers, plugins, and outputs of other agents.

For out-of-the-box creatures you can try today, see [**kt-biome**](https://github.com/Kohaku-Lab/kt-biome) — the showcase pack of useful agents and plugins built on top of the framework.

## Where it fits

|  | Product | Framework | Utility / Wrapper |
|--|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **LLM App** | ChatGPT, Claude.ai | LangChain, LangGraph, Dify | DSPy |
| **Agent** | ***kt-biome***, Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes Agent… | ***KohakuTerrarium***, smolagents | — |
| **Multi-Agent** | ***kt-biome*** | ***KohakuTerrarium***  | CrewAI, AutoGen |

Most tooling sits below the agent layer or jumps straight to multi-agent orchestration with a thin idea of what an agent is. KohakuTerrarium starts with the agent itself.

A creature is made of:

- **Controller** — the reasoning loop
- **Input** — how events enter the agent
- **Output** — how results leave the agent
- **Tools** — what actions it can take
- **Triggers** — what wakes it up
- **Sub-agents** — internal delegation for specialised tasks

A terrarium composes multiple creatures horizontally through channels, lifecycle management, and observability.

## Key features

- **Agent-level abstraction.** The six-module creature model is the first-class concept. Every new agent shape is "write a config and maybe a few custom modules," not "rebuild the runtime."
- **Built-in session persistence and resume.** Sessions store operational state, not just chat history. Resume a run hours later with `kt resume`.
- **Searchable session history.** Every event is indexed. `kt search` and the `search_memory` tool let you (and the agent) look up past work.
- **Non-blocking context compaction.** Long-running agents keep working while context is compacted in the background.
- **Comprehensive built-in tools and sub-agents.** File, shell, web, JSON, notebook/Jupyter, search, editing, planning, review, research, plus the `group_*` graph-editor tools registered on privileged nodes.
- **MCP support.** Connect stdio, streamable HTTP, or legacy SSE/HTTP MCP servers per-agent or globally; tools surface in the prompt automatically.
- **Package system.** Install creatures / terrariums / plugins / LLM presets from Git or local paths; compose installed packages with inheritance.
- **Python-native.** Agents are async Python objects. Embed them inside tools, triggers, plugins, or outputs of other agents.
- **Composition algebra.** `>>`, `&`, `|`, `*`, `.iterate` operators for stitching agents into pipelines programmatically.
- **Multiple runtime surfaces.** CLI, TUI, web dashboard, and desktop app out of the box.
- **Useful OOTB creatures via [`kt-biome`](https://github.com/Kohaku-Lab/kt-biome).** Start by running strong default agents; customise or inherit from them later.

                          +------------------+
```

A creature is a standalone agent with its own runtime, tools, sub-agents, prompts, and state.

```bash
kt run path/to/creature
kt run @package/path/to/creature
```

(vertical/private delegation)
```

- **Studio** is the management framework used by the web dashboard, desktop app, and HTTP API. It owns catalog views, identity/settings, active sessions, persistence, attach/resume, editors, and live traces. It does not reason.
- **Laboratory (Lab)** is the optional network layer between Studio and Terrarium. In single-machine mode it is not even imported. In `--mode lab-host` it lets one host coordinate creatures on N worker machines via WebSocket: Studio still calls one `TerrariumService`, Terrarium still ships local channel sends, but a `MultiNodeTerrariumService` routes per-creature ops to the right worker and a session-event tee mirrors every worker's session file back to the host. See [Laboratory concept](docs/en/concepts/laboratory.md) and the [Laboratory guide](docs/en/guides/laboratory.md).
- **Terrarium** is the runtime engine that hosts every running creature in the process. A standalone agent is a one-creature graph; a multi-creature team is a connected graph. The engine runs no LLM and has no reasoning loop, but it owns *structure*: which creatures share a connected component, which channels exist, where each turn-end output is delivered, which session store backs which graph, and the auto-merge / auto-split bookkeeping that follows topology changes.
- **Privileged node** is a creature inside a graph that has been granted the `group_*` tools (graph editor: spawn / remove creatures, draw / delete channels, start / stop members). The recipe `root:` keyword promotes one node to privileged + applies the standard user-facing wiring (`report_to_root` channel, listen on every channel). Privilege can also be granted inline (`privileged: true`) or imperatively (`is_privileged=True`).
- **Creature** owns reasoning: controller, tools, triggers, sub-agents, plugins, memory, I/O, prompts, and private state. Creatures do not need to know whether they are alone or part of a graph.
- **Sub-agents** are vertical/private delegation inside one creature. Prefer them when one controller can decompose the task internally; use Terrarium when multiple peer creatures need horizontal cooperation.

### Channels and output wiring

Channels and output wiring are the horizontal cooperation substrate between creatures:

- **Channel** — named broadcast pipe. Every listener subscribed to it receives every send. Use for conditional / optional / observed traffic.
- **Output wiring** — deterministic pipeline edges that auto-deliver a creature's turn-end output to named targets, no `send_message` required.

### Modules

A creature has six conceptual modules. **Five of them are user-extensible** — you swap their implementations in config or in Python. The sixth, the controller, is the reasoning loop that drives them; you rarely swap it (and when you do, you're writing the framework's successor).

| Module | What it does | Example custom use |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| **Input** | Receives external events | Discord listener, webhook, voice input |
| **Output** | Delivers agent output | Discord sender, TTS, file writer |
| **Tool** | Executes actions | API calls, database access, RAG retrieval |
| **Trigger** | Generates automatic events | Timer, scheduler, channel watcher |
| **Sub-agent** | Delegated task execution | Planning, code review, research |

Plus **plugins**, which modify the connections *between* modules without forking them (prompt plugins, lifecycle hooks). See [plugins guide](docs/en/guides/plugins.md).

### Environment and session

- **Environment** — shared terrarium state (shared channels).
- **Session** — private creature state (scratchpad, private channels, sub-agent state).

Private by default, shared by opt-in.

## Practical capabilities

KohakuTerrarium already ships:

- Built-in file, shell, web, JSON, notebook/Jupyter, channel, trigger, and introspection tools, including single-edit and multi-edit file mutation primitives.
- Built-in sub-agents for exploration, planning, implementation, review, summarisation, and research.
- Background tool execution and non-blocking agent flow.
- Session persistence with resumable operational state.
- FTS + vector memory search (model2vec / sentence-transformer / API embedding providers).
- Non-blocking auto-compaction for long-running agents.
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration — stdio, streamable HTTP, and legacy SSE/HTTP transports.
- Package manager for creatures, plugins, terrariums, and reusable agent packs (`kt install`, `kt update`).
- Python embedding through the `Terrarium` engine plus lower-level `Agent` access.
- HTTP and WebSocket serving.
- Web dashboard and native desktop app.
- Custom module and plugin systems.

## Programmatic usage

Agents are async Python values. One `Terrarium` engine per process hosts every running creature — a standalone agent is just a 1-creature graph in the engine.

```python
import asyncio
from kohakuterrarium import Terrarium

async def main():
    # Solo creature
    engine, alice = await Terrarium.with_creature("@kt-biome/creatures/swe")
    try:
        async for chunk in alice.chat("Explain what this codebase does."):
            print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
    finally:
        await engine.shutdown()

    # Multi-agent recipe
    engine = await Terrarium.from_recipe("@kt-biome/terrariums/swe_team")
    try:
        async for chunk in engine["swe"].chat("Fix the auth bug."):
            print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
    finally:
        await engine.shutdown()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Composition algebra

Because agents are Python values, they compose with operators. `>>` (sequence), `&` (parallel), `|` (fallback), `*N` (retry), `.iterate` (async loop):

```python
import asyncio
from kohakuterrarium.compose import agent, factory
from kohakuterrarium.core.config import load_agent_config

def make_agent(name, prompt):
    config = load_agent_config("@kt-biome/creatures/general")
    config.name, config.system_prompt, config.tools, config.subagents = name, prompt, [], []
    return config

async def main():
    # Persistent agents (accumulate conversation)
    async with await agent(make_agent("writer", "You are a writer.")) as writer, \
               await agent(make_agent("reviewer", "You are a strict reviewer. Say APPROVED if good.")) as reviewer:

        pipeline = writer >> (lambda text: f"Review this:\n{text}") >> reviewer

        async for feedback in pipeline.iterate("Write a haiku about coding"):
            print(f"Reviewer: {feedback[:100]}")
            if "APPROVED" in feedback:
                break

    # Parallel ensemble with retry + fallback
    fast = factory(make_agent("fast", "Answer concisely."))
    deep = factory(make_agent("deep", "Answer thoroughly."))
    safe = (fast & deep) >> (lambda results: max(results, key=len))
    safe_with_retry = (safe * 2) | fast
    print(await safe_with_retry("What is recursion?"))

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Runtime surfaces

### CLI and TUI

- **cli** — rich inline terminal experience
- **tui** — full-screen Textual application
- **plain** — simple stdout/stdin for pipes and CI

See [CLI Reference](docs/en/reference/cli.md).

### Web dashboard

Vue-based dashboard + FastAPI server backed by the Studio management layer.

```bash
kt web                       # one-shot, foreground
kt serve start               # long-running daemon
# Frontend dev: npm run dev --prefix src/kohakuterrarium-frontend
```

See [HTTP API](docs/en/reference/http.md), [Serving guide](docs/en/guides/serving.md), [Frontend Architecture](docs/en/dev/frontend.md).

### Desktop app

`kt app` launches the web UI inside a native desktop window (requires `pywebview`).

## Sessions, memory, and resume

Sessions save to `~/.kohakuterrarium/sessions/` unless disabled.

```bash
kt resume            # pick interactively
kt resume --last     # resume most recent
kt resume swe_team   # resume by name prefix
```

The same store powers searchable history:

```bash
kt embedding <session>                       # build FTS + vector indices
kt search <session> "auth bug fix"           # hybrid/semantic/FTS search
```

And the agent can search its own history via the `search_memory` tool.

`.kohakutr` files store conversation, tool calls, events, scratchpad, sub-agent state, channel messages, jobs, resumable triggers, and config metadata.

See [Sessions](docs/en/guides/sessions.md), [Memory](docs/en/guides/memory.md).

## Packages, defaults, and examples

Creatures are meant to be packaged, installed, reused, and shared.

```bash

## FAQ

### General

**What is KohakuTerrarium?**
KohakuTerrarium is a Python-native AI agent framework for building autonomous agents. The public hierarchy is: **Creature** for the agent unit, **Terrarium** for the runtime engine that owns the creature graph (topology, channels, sessions — no LLM of its own), and **Studio** for catalog / session / persistence / API management above the engine.

**How does it differ from other agent frameworks?**
Unlike monolithic frameworks, KohakuTerrarium keeps responsibilities separated: creatures own reasoning and tools, the Terrarium engine owns graph topology / channels / lifecycle / session bookkeeping, and Studio owns management surfaces. Horizontal teams use Terrarium recipes and channels; Python request pipelines can still use composition algebra.

### Installation & Setup

**What Python version is required?**
Python 3.10 or higher. Install via `pip install kohakuterrarium`.

**Which LLM providers are supported?**
Codex OAuth, OpenAI/OpenRouter-style providers, native Anthropic, Google Gemini, local OpenAI-compatible servers (Ollama, vLLM), and other OpenAI-compatible cloud providers. Configure with `kt login`, `kt config llm add`, `kt config provider add`, or provider API keys.

**Can I use local models?**
Yes. Point the LLM endpoint to your local server (Ollama, vLLM, etc.) and configure the model name in your creature configuration.

### Core Concepts

**What is a "Creature"?**
A Creature is the standalone agent unit: controller, tools, triggers, sub-agents, plugins, memory, I/O, prompts, and private state. It can run alone or as a node in a Terrarium graph.

**What is a "Terrarium"?**
A Terrarium is the runtime engine that hosts creature graphs. It runs no LLM and has no reasoning loop, but it owns the structural decisions: connected components, channel registry, hot-plug, output wiring, session merge / split bookkeeping. Each creature still owns its controller, tools, memory, and private state.

**What are "Plugins"?**
Plugins extend the framework's capabilities — custom tools, I/O modules, triggers, or behavior hooks. They follow a hook-based system for clean integration.

### Development

**How do I create a custom Creature?**
Define a YAML configuration with tools, prompts, and behavior, or use the Python API to build one programmatically. See `docs/en/tutorials/first-creature.md` for a step-by-step guide.

**Can I embed agents in my Python application?**
Yes. KohakuTerrarium provides a Python-native API for programmatic agent creation and execution. See `examples/code/` and `docs/en/guides/programmatic-usage.md`.

**How does multi-agent composition work?**
Use Terrarium recipes/engine channels/output wiring for horizontal multi-agent teams. Use `compose` for lightweight Python-side request pipelines (`>>`, `&`, `|`, retry) when you do not need a long-lived graph. See `examples/terrariums/` and `examples/code/`.

### Troubleshooting

**Why is my creature not responding?**
Check that your LLM provider is configured correctly with `kt login`. Verify network connectivity and API key validity.

**How do I debug agent behavior?**
Use `kt run --verbose` for detailed logs. Resume or inspect prior work with `kt resume`, search it with `kt search`, or use the Studio session viewer in the web/desktop UI.
