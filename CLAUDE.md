# KohakuTerrarium

A universal agent framework for building any type of fully self-driven agent system.

## Project Overview

KohakuTerrarium is a Python framework that enables building any kind of agent system - from SWE agents like Claude Code to conversational bots like Neuro-sama to autonomous monitoring systems. The name "Terrarium" reflects how the framework allows you to build different self-contained agent ecosystems.

## Code Conventions

### File Organization
- Source code: `src/kohakuterrarium/`
- Frontend (Vue 3): `src/kohakuterrarium-frontend/`
- Creature templates: `creatures/`
- Terrarium templates: `terrariums/`
- Examples: `examples/` (agent-apps, terrariums, plugins, code)
- Documentation: `docs/` (en, zh-CN, zh-TW)
- Max lines per file: 600 (hard max: 1000, enforced by `tests/unit/test_file_sizes.py`)
- Highly modularized - one responsibility per module

### Import Rules
1. No imports inside functions (except optional dep and lazy import to avoid long init time)
2. Import grouping order:
   - Built-in modules
   - Third-party packages
   - KohakuTerrarium modules
3. Import ordering within groups:
   - `import` statements before `from` imports
   - Shorter paths before longer paths (by dot count)
   - Alphabetical order (a-z)

### Python Style
- Target: Python 3.10+ (CI matrix runs 3.10 through 3.14)
- Use modern type hints: `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `X | None` (NOT `List`, `Tuple`, `Dict`, `Optional`, `Union`)
- Prefer `match-case` over deeply nested `if-elif-else`
- Full asyncio throughout (mark sync modules as "require blocking" or "can be to_thread")
- Practical dependencies allowed (pydantic, httpx, rich, etc.)

### Frontend Style
- Vue 3 + Vite, JavaScript only (no TypeScript)
- Run `npm run format:check` and `npm run build` before committing

### Development Setup
- Use `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"` for editable install
- **Never use `sys.path.insert` hacks** in examples or tests - always rely on proper package install
- Examples and tests should import from `kohakuterrarium.*` directly

### Logging (No print!)
- **Avoid naive `print()` in library code** - use structured logging
- Use custom logger based on `logging` module (NOT loguru)
- Format: `[HH:MM:SS] [module.name] [LEVEL] message`
- Color coding: DEBUG=gray, INFO=green, WARNING=yellow, ERROR=red
- **Avoid reserved LogRecord attributes** in extra kwargs: `name`, `msg`, `args`, `levelname`, `levelno`, `pathname`, `filename`, `module`, `lineno`, `funcName`, `created`, `msecs`, `relativeCreated`, `thread`, `threadName`, `process`, `processName`, `message`
- Exception: Test suites (`tests/`) can use simpler output

### Post-impl tasks
1. Verify all your impl follow the rules (ESPECIALLY in-function import!)
2. `black src/ tests/` and `ruff check src/ tests/`
3. Ensure new stuff has corresponding tests in the right tier (see "Test
   suite" below) — new unit tests pin behaviour; touched folders/journeys
   get their integration/e2e workflow extended, not a new test function
4. Logically separated git commits and push (user may explicitly say "draft" — if so, don't push)

### Audit loop (multi-step impl work — REQUIRED)

For any task larger than a one-file change, do NOT stop at "tests
pass." Run this loop until it converges:

1. **Implement** the slice.
2. **Write new tests** that pin the behaviour you added. Negative
   cases (the bug you'd accidentally introduce) count more than
   positive cases.
3. **Execute the full test suite** for the affected tiers
   (unit/integration/e2e + frontend vitest). Lint too (`black`,
   `ruff`, `prettier`).
4. **Audit** the diff with a critical eye — three categories:
   - **Clear bugs:** typos, wrong field names, off-by-ones,
     `await` missing on async calls, dead branches.
   - **Integrity bugs:** invariants you broke — state that's
     supposed to be in sync now drifts, two writers race a single
     dict, a cache outlives the thing it caches.
   - **Behavior bugs:** the code does what's typed but the wrong
     thing for the spec — wrong default, silently-swallowed
     error, condition gates the wrong branch.
5. **If you find any bug the tests didn't catch:** first augment
   the test so it *would* have caught it, confirm the augmented
   test fails on the unfixed code, then fix the bug. Tests that
   miss real bugs are evidence the test suite is the bug; patching
   tests first prevents the same blind spot next time.
6. **Loop** to step 3. Stop only when the audit finds nothing AND
   every test is green.

This loop is the difference between "I wrote code and tests passed"
and "I delivered working code." Treat the loop as part of the
definition-of-done, not optional polish.

### Test suite (three tiers)

`tests/` has three tiers, each a *different shape of test*, not just a
different size. `tests/README.md` is the full spec — the summary:

- **`tests/unit/` — one source file → one test (or test-class).** Tests
  an individual class / method against its real dependencies
  (deterministic stubs only for genuine I/O). Shape checks (`isinstance`,
  `key in dict`, `is not None`) are legitimate **here and only here**.
  Target: 95–100% line coverage per core-lib file; any sub-95% file
  needs a written justification in the test or a tracking issue.
- **`tests/integration/` — one core-lib folder → one test-class.** Each
  test method runs a **complete feature workflow end-to-end in a single
  function** (init → drive → read back → resume → verify), mirroring how
  the real consumer drives that folder. Splitting a workflow into
  separate "init" / "read" / "resume" tests is unit-tier thinking and
  cannot catch cross-step bugs. The integration test for a folder *is*
  that folder's most comprehensive usage example.
- **`tests/e2e/` — whole project → a handful of fat journey tests.** Each
  is a single function simulating an entire user session (chat → switch
  model → toggle plugin → interrupt → resume → branch …). ~10 journeys
  cover `{programmatic, HTTP+WS} × {creature, terrarium, studio}` +
  multi-node. e2e answers one question: *is the system runnable, end to
  end?*

Tier discipline: **behavior asserts, not shape asserts** (every mutation
test observes the side effect); **real collaborators, not mocks** (the
only seam is the LLM — `kohakuterrarium.testing.llm.ScriptedLLM`,
monkeypatched at BOTH `bootstrap.llm.create_llm_provider` and
`bootstrap.agent_init.create_llm_provider`); **to raise integration/e2e
coverage, fatten the existing workflow functions — do NOT add more test
functions.** Carve-out files (3rd-party providers, platform PTY,
end-user CLI/UI, the pywebview boot path) are listed in
`tests/README.md` and excluded from coverage targets.

Unit + integration run in CI on the full OS × Python matrix
(3.12+). **The e2e tier is NOT run in CI** — those tests spin up
real WebSocket-backed lab clusters, subprocess workers, and
Vue-frontend journey simulations whose timing depends on
hosted-runner network + scheduler behavior that's too volatile
to gate every PR on. Run e2e locally before shipping anything
that touches the multi-node / Studio / serving stack; bug
anchoring + regression protection on `main` come from unit +
integration.

## Core Architecture Concepts (CRITICAL)

### The four-layer hierarchy

```
User <-> Studio (management framework)
              |
              v  catalog / identity / sessions / persistence / editors / attach
         +-----------+
         | Terrarium |  <-- runtime engine: graph topology, channels,
         +-----------+      hot-plug, output wiring, session bookkeeping.
              |             No LLM, no reasoning loop. Owns structure.
              v
         | creature | creature | ... |  <-- the agent framework runs here
              |
              v
         | controller + LLM + tools + triggers + sub-agents + plugins + I/O |
```

**Studio** (`src/kohakuterrarium/studio/`): the management framework above the
engine. Six namespaces — `catalog`, `identity`, `sessions`, `persistence`,
`editors`, `attach`. The web dashboard, desktop app, and `kt` CLI are all
adapters over Studio. Studio is *not* a UI; it's the shared Python surface UIs
delegate to.

**Terrarium** (`src/kohakuterrarium/terrarium/engine.py`): the runtime engine
that hosts every running creature in the process. It runs no LLM and has no
reasoning loop — those live in the creatures it hosts. What it owns is
*structure*: which creatures share a connected component, which channels
exist between them, where each turn-end output is delivered, which session
store backs which graph, and the bookkeeping that follows when the topology
changes (auto-merge / auto-split, session lineage). One engine per process;
multiple disconnected graphs may coexist inside it.

**Creature**: dual concept. (1) Config: a folder with `agent.yaml` +
`system.md` defining an agent. (2) Runtime: a `Creature` handle
(`terrarium/creature_host.py`) wrapping a live `Agent` with engine-side
metadata (`graph_id`, `is_privileged`, `listen_channels`, `send_channels`,
`parent_creature_id`). Same agent config can run privileged in one terrarium
and unprivileged in another. Sub-agents inside a creature are VERTICAL
hierarchy (internal delegation, invisible to outside).

**Privileged node**: a creature inside a graph that has been granted the
[group tools](#privileged-tools-and-the-group_-surface) needed to mutate the
graph: spawn / remove creatures, draw / delete channels, start / stop
members. The recipe `root:` keyword is one way to make a node privileged;
recipes can also use `privileged: true` inline; engines accept
`is_privileged=True` at creature-add time. Workers spawned by `group_add_node`
are NOT privileged.

**Two composition levels (never mix them):**
- VERTICAL (inside creature): controller → sub-agents (private, hierarchical)
- HORIZONTAL (terrarium graph): creature ↔ creature via channels (peer, opaque)

### Dynamic graph + session interaction

Topology can change at runtime. The engine keeps it consistent:
- Add a creature → joins a specific graph (default: fresh singleton).
- Remove a creature → may auto-split the graph if it was a bridge.
- Connect across graphs → auto-merge graphs, union environments, merge
  session stores into one (with `parent_session_ids` recording lineage).
- Disconnect / remove channel → may auto-split, allocate fresh environments
  per side, duplicate session store into each side.
- Each graph has one session store; resume reconstructs topology from the
  recipe path stored in session metadata, NOT from a frozen snapshot. The
  recipe is the source of truth on resume; lineage metadata
  (`parent_session_ids`, `merged_at`, `split_at`) survives but split state
  does not.

### Privileged tools and the `group_*` surface

Tools registered on every creature: `send_channel`, `group_send`.

Tools registered ONLY on privileged nodes:
- `group_add_node` — spawn a creature into the caller's graph
- `group_remove_node` — remove a creature (may auto-split)
- `group_start_node` / `group_stop_node` — start / stop members
- `group_channel` — CRUD on channels and per-creature wiring
- `group_wire` — output-wiring edges
- `group_status` — snapshot the caller's graph

These are the runtime "graph editor" — an LLM-driven privileged node uses
them to evolve the team mid-run. Mutations go through topology pure
functions (`terrarium/topology.py`) → environment updates → session
coordination → emit `EngineEvent`.

### Channels are broadcast-only at the graph layer

All terrarium graph channels are broadcast — every listener receives every
send. The `type:` field in older `terrarium.yaml` channel declarations is
ignored at the engine layer; new configs should omit it. The
`SubAgentChannel` queue primitive in `core/channel.py` still exists but is
internal to creature ↔ sub-agent plumbing, not user-facing.

### Built-in plugins (cross-cutting concerns are NOT framework features)

Four cross-cutting concerns ship as ordinary plugins, not framework code:
- `sandbox` — capability gating (filesystem / network / subprocess)
- `budget` — turn / tool-call / walltime accounting
- `permgate` — interactive user approval for tool calls
- `compact.auto` — trigger context compaction on high token use

The framework's tool executor knows nothing about any of these. They use
`pre_tool_execute` + `runtime_services` hooks like any other plugin. This
is the canonical example of where the framework / plugin boundary lives:
security, resource limits, and user gating are all *cross-cutting policies*,
not framework features. When designing new functionality, ask first whether
it could be a plugin instead — usually it should.

## Architecture Overview

### Key Design Principle: Controller as Orchestrator

**The controller's role is to dispatch tasks, not to do heavy work itself.**

- Controller outputs should be SHORT: tool calls, sub-agent dispatches, status updates
- Long outputs (user-facing content) should come from **output sub-agents**
- This keeps controller lightweight, fast, and focused on decision-making

### Five Major Systems
1. **Input** - Explicit input that triggers the agent (user request, ASR, group chat message)
2. **Trigger** - Automatic system that triggers agent (timers, events, conditions, composites)
3. **Controller** - Main LLM that **orchestrates** - dispatches tasks, makes decisions
4. **Tool Calling** - Background execution of tools/sub-agents (non-blocking)
5. **Output** - Final output routing (stdout, file, TTS stream, API)

### Unified Event Model

Everything flows through `TriggerEvent` (defined in `core/events.py`):
- Input completion → TriggerEvent
- Timer/condition triggers → TriggerEvent
- Tool completion → TriggerEvent
- Sub-agent output → TriggerEvent

Stackable events can be batched when occurring simultaneously.

### Key Concepts
- **Sub-agents**: Nested agents with own controller + tools
  - Default: output to parent controller only
  - **Output sub-agent**: `output_to: external` - can stream directly to user
  - **Interactive sub-agent**: `interactive: true` - stays alive, receives context updates
- **Skills**: Procedural knowledge ("how to do something")
- **Tools**: Executable functions with documentation ("how to call, what happens")
- **First-citizen memory**: Folder with txt/md files, read-write (some can be protected)
- **Plugins**: Hook-based extension layer (pre/post around tool calls, LLM calls, sub-agent runs, etc.)

### Tool Execution Modes
1. **Direct/Blocking**: Complete all jobs, return results
2. **Background**: Periodic status updates, context refresh
3. **Stateful**: Multi-turn interaction (like Python generators with yield)

## Configuration Format

- **JSON/YAML/TOML**: Overall setup (controller, input, trigger, tools, output modules)
- **Markdown**: System prompts with Jinja-like templating
- **Call syntax**: Configurable format (short, easy to parse, state-machine friendly)

## Major Systems

1. **Agent runtime** (`core/`) — Turn-based LLM controller, async non-blocking tool execution, unified TriggerEvent queue, sub-agent dispatch.
2. **Multi-agent orchestration** (`terrarium/`) — Pure wiring layer. Channels between creatures. Optional root-agent management interface. Hot-plug.
3. **Session persistence** (`session/`) — `.kohakutr` files via KohakuVault (SQLite). Append-only event log + conversation snapshots + sub-agent capture + channel history + scratchpad. Resume via `kt resume`.
4. **Memory** (`session/memory.py` + `session/embedding.py`) — FTS5 + vector search over recorded events. Embedding via model2vec / sentence-transformer / API providers.
5. **HTTP API + Web dashboard** (`api/` + `src/kohakuterrarium-frontend/`) — FastAPI REST + WebSocket. Vue 3 frontend served from `web_dist/`. Multi-tab chat, tool accordion, session resume.
6. **Plugin system** (`modules/plugin/`) — Pre/post hooks around tool execution, LLM calls, sub-agent runs, plus fire-and-forget callbacks. `PluginBlockError` in a `pre_tool_execute` becomes the tool result. All plugins run linearly by priority.
7. **MCP integration** (`mcp/`) — Stdio + HTTP transport. Tools indirected through four meta-tools instead of mirrored — keeps the agent's prompt small.
8. **Compose algebra** (`compose/`) — `>>` sequence, `&` parallel, `|` fallback, `*` retry. User-facing only; framework does not depend on it.
9. **Package system** (`packages.py` + `kt install` / `kt uninstall`) — Sharing creature / terrarium / plugin bundles.
10. **Desktop packaging** (`__briefcase__.py` + briefcase tooling) — macOS / Windows / Linux native app builds.

## Plugin System

`modules/plugin/` defines two extension patterns:

- **Pre/post hooks** — wrap framework methods. Pre-hooks can transform input or block (`PluginBlockError`); post-hooks can transform output. Hooks are linear (not nested) by priority. Returning `None` keeps the value unchanged.
- **Callbacks** — fire-and-forget notifications.

Plugin context (`PluginContext`) exposes: `agent_name`, `working_dir`, `session_id`, `model`, `switch_model()`, `inject_event()`, plus plugin-scoped `get_state()` / `set_state()` persisted to the session store.

Loaded by `bootstrap/plugins.py`. Manager calls live in `core/agent_handlers.py` (pre-LLM) and `core/agent_tools.py` (pre/post tool, pre/post sub-agent).

## MCP Integration

`mcp/client.py` owns per-server `ClientSession`s for stdio and streamable-HTTP MCP servers. `MCPClientManager` is attached to `Agent._mcp_manager` when the agent config declares `mcp_servers`. The `mcp` SDK is a deferred import inside `connect()` — frameworks without it installed start fine.

The agent does **not** see MCP tools as native tools. Instead, four meta-tools (`mcp_list`, `mcp_call`, `mcp_connect`, `mcp_disconnect`) route to the manager. This keeps the system prompt short regardless of how many MCP servers the user attaches, and contains MCP failures to a single tool call.

## Compose Algebra

Pythonic operators over `AgentSession` and arbitrary callables. Lives in `compose/`:

```python
pipeline = explorer >> (planner & critic) >> writer
result = await (pipeline | fallback) * 3
```

| Op | Combinator | Semantics |
|----|------------|-----------|
| `a >> b` | `Sequence` | Run `a`, pipe output to `b`. |
| `a & b` | `Product`  | Run concurrently, return tuple. |
| `a \| b` | `Fallback` | Try `a`; on exception, run `b` with the original input. |
| `a * N`  | `Retry`    | Retry `a` up to `N` times. |

Pure async combinators with zero framework coupling beyond `serving/agent_session`. Nothing inside the framework imports `compose/`.

## Prompt System Design (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW)

### System Prompt Aggregation

The system prompt is built by `prompt/aggregator.py` which combines:
1. **Base prompt from system.md** — agent personality / guidelines ONLY
2. **Auto-generated tool list** — name + one-line description for each tool
3. **Framework hints** — tool call syntax, ##info##, ##read## commands
4. **Plugin contributions** (`prompt/plugins.py`) — plugin-supplied prompt fragments

### What Goes Where

| Content | Location | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Agent personality / role | `system.md` | "You are a SWE agent" |
| Agent-specific guidelines | `system.md` | "Use tools immediately" |
| Tool list (name + desc) | AUTO-GENERATED | `- bash: Execute shell commands` |
| Tool call syntax | `aggregator.py` hints | `##tool##...##tool##` |
| Full tool documentation | `builtin_skills/` | Loaded via `##info##` |

### NEVER Do These

1. **NEVER put tool list in system.md** — it's auto-aggregated
2. **NEVER put tool call syntax in system.md** — it's in framework hints
3. **NEVER put full tool docs in system prompt** — use `##info##` command
4. **NEVER hardcode tool descriptions** — they come from tool classes

### On-Demand Documentation

Full tool / sub-agent documentation is loaded ONLY when requested:
- Controller uses `##info tool_name##` to get full docs
- Docs come from: agent folder override → `builtin_skills/` → `tool.get_full_documentation()`

## Tool Execution Design (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW)

### Async Non-Blocking Execution

Tool execution follows this flow:
1. **During LLM streaming**: When `##tool##` block detected, start tool immediately via `asyncio.create_task()`
2. **Don't block streaming**: LLM continues outputting while tools run in background
3. **Parallel execution**: Multiple tools run simultaneously
4. **After streaming ends**: Wait for all direct tools with `asyncio.gather()`
5. **Batch results**: Combine all results into single event for controller

### NEVER Do These

1. **NEVER queue tools until LLM finishes** — start immediately when detected
2. **NEVER execute tools sequentially** — run in parallel with `gather()`
3. **NEVER block LLM output for tool execution** — they run concurrently

### Tool Execution Modes

- **Direct/Blocking**: All jobs complete before returning (default for SWE agents)
- **Background**: Periodic status updates, context refresh
- **Stateful**: Multi-turn interaction (sub-agents)

## Session System

Sessions store everything in a `.kohakutr` file (SQLite via KohakuVault):
- Conversation snapshots (raw message dicts via msgpack, preserves tool_calls)
- Append-only event log (every text chunk, tool call, trigger, token usage)
- Sub-agent conversation capture (saved before destruction)
- Channel message history
- Scratchpad state
- Plugin-scoped state (`plugin:<name>:<key>`)

Resume rebuilds the agent from config and injects the saved conversation.

Key files: `session/store.py`, `session/output.py`, `session/resume.py`, `session/history.py`.

## CI Matrix

CI is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. PRs are not reviewed until CI is green on the contributor's fork. The matrix:

- **Lint**: `ruff check src/ tests/` + `black --check src/ tests/` (Python 3.13)
- **Tests**: `pytest tests/unit/` then `pytest tests/integration/` — unit + integration tiers only, on Python 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 × Linux / Windows / macOS (3.14 on Windows excluded — pythonnet has no wheel). The e2e tier is intentionally NOT run in CI; see `tests/README.md` (run it locally before shipping multi-node / Studio / serving changes). Python 3.10 / 3.11 still install via `requires-python = ">=3.10"` but are supported best-effort — CI does not validate them.
- **File-size guards**: `pytest tests/unit/test_file_sizes.py`
- **Frontend**: `npm ci` + `npm run format:check` + `npm run build` in `src/kohakuterrarium-frontend/`, plus check that build output landed in `src/kohakuterrarium/web_dist/`
- **Wheel build**: build wheel, install into clean venv, run `kt --help` and `kt app --help`
