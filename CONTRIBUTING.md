# Contributing to KohakuTerrarium

Thanks for your interest in the project. This document is short on purpose — please read it end-to-end before opening an issue or PR. Following the rules below is what keeps everyone's time well-spent.

**English only.** All issues, PRs, commit messages, and code comments in this repository must be in English. PRs in other languages will be asked to translate before review. Discussion in other languages belongs in the community channels below.

The only exception: **multi-locale documentation files** (e.g. `README.zh.md`, `docs/zh/`, other translated `*.md` under `docs/`). Translations and locale-specific doc content are welcome and expected to be in their target language. Everything else — code, comments, commits, PR titles/descriptions, issue text — stays English.

## Community

Open a thread before you write code. The fastest channels:

- **QQ group**: 1097666427
- **Discord**: https://discord.gg/xWYrkyvJ2s
- **GitHub Issues**: https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/KohakuTerrarium/issues

Issue templates live in [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/).

## Before You Open a PR

We enforce this strictly. The point is not gatekeeping — it is to make sure no one (you included) wastes time on work that conflicts with the team's in-flight direction. PRs closed under this policy can be **reopened immediately** once the discussion-and-alignment step is done; we are happy to do that.

### Feature PRs require prior approval

A "feature PR" is anything that adds new functionality, changes a public API, alters core architecture, introduces a new module/tool/sub-agent shape, or changes user-visible behavior in a non-trivial way.

Before opening a feature PR, you need a **pre-existing public discussion trail** and an explicit maintainer go-ahead.

Accepted paths:

1. An open **GitHub issue** created before the PR, with a maintainer comment giving approval (or an `approved` label).
2. A **discussion in QQ or Discord** with a maintainer who has clearly approved the work.

If the approval happened outside GitHub, the PR description must still link back to the public context as clearly as possible (for example: issue link, message permalink, quoted maintainer approval, date, and maintainer name/handle).

**Submitting an issue and a PR at the same time does not count.**
The issue/discussion must exist first, the proposal must be discussed, and approval must land before the PR is opened. Opening the PR before that approval lands will get the PR closed.

### Feature PR checklist requirement

If your PR is a feature / behavior / API / architecture change, your PR description must explicitly state all of the following:

- the issue or discussion link
- when that issue/discussion was opened
- who approved it
- whether the PR matches the approved scope

If any of that is missing, reviewers will treat the PR as not yet ready for review.

PRs that arrive without traceable approval will be closed with a short pointer to this document. This is firm but not personal — open the issue, get aligned, and reopen. We will help you do that.

### Bug fixes and minor enhancements are looser

These can go straight to PR:

- Bug fixes (clear bug, clear fix, no architectural change)
- UI/UX adjustments that do not change behavior or layout meaningfully
- Documentation fixes, typo fixes, dead-link fixes
- Test additions for existing behavior
- Small refactors confined to a single module that do not change public APIs

We still **strongly recommend** opening an issue or pinging the community channels first, even for these. Reasons:

- Your fix may collide with in-progress work the team has not pushed yet.
- The bug may already be fixed on a private branch.
- The "obvious" fix may conflict with a planned redesign of the same area.

A two-line message in Discord before you start saves hours of rework.

### What "approval" looks like

A maintainer comment like "go ahead", "approved", "please open a PR for this", a thumbs-up reaction on a concrete proposal, or an `approved` label. If you are unsure whether you have approval, you do not — ask explicitly.

### What to include in the PR description

Use the PR template. Do not delete the checklist sections just because they are inconvenient.

At minimum, every PR description should include:

- a short summary of the change
- the PR type (bug fix / docs / tests / refactor / feature / breaking change)
- exact validation steps or commands you ran
- linked issue(s) / discussion(s)
- any skipped checks with a concrete reason

For feature PRs, the issue/discussion link is not optional.

## CI Must Be Green on Your Fork

We do not review PRs with red CI. Before opening a PR:

1. **Enable GitHub Actions on your fork** (Settings → Actions → Allow all actions). Forks have Actions disabled by default.
2. Push your branch to your fork.
3. Wait for the full CI matrix to finish on the fork. Open the PR only after it is green.

The CI matrix that must pass is defined in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml):

- **Lint**: `ruff check` + `black --check` (Python 3.13)
- **Tests**: all three tiers — `pytest tests/unit/` then `pytest tests/integration/ tests/e2e/` — on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 × Linux / Windows / macOS (3.14 on Windows is excluded — pythonnet has no wheel yet)
- **File-size guards**: `pytest tests/unit/test_file_sizes.py`
- **Frontend**: `npm ci` + `npm run format:check` + `npm run build` in `src/kohakuterrarium-frontend/`, plus a check that the build output landed in `src/kohakuterrarium/web_dist/`
- **Wheel build**: builds the wheel, installs it into a clean venv, runs `kt --help` and `kt app --help`

The test suite has three tiers — see [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md) for what each tier is and how to write them.

Local pre-flight (run all of these before pushing):

```bash
# Python
ruff check src/ tests/
black --check src/ tests/
pytest tests/unit/ -q --ignore=tests/unit/test_file_sizes.py
pytest tests/unit/test_file_sizes.py -q
pytest tests/integration/ tests/e2e/ -q

# Frontend
cd src/kohakuterrarium-frontend
npm ci
npm run format:check
npm run build
```

If you cannot run a piece locally (e.g. no Windows machine for the matrix), that is what your fork's CI is for. Push and watch it.

---

## Setup

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/KohakuTerrarium.git
cd KohakuTerrarium
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Frontend (optional — only if you'll touch the web UI)
cd src/kohakuterrarium-frontend
npm install
```

Submodules are needed for some tests; if you forgot `--recurse-submodules`, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` after cloning.

## Code Conventions

The full conventions live in **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)**. Read it before submitting code. The non-negotiables:

### Python

- **Python 3.10+ minimum.** Use modern type hints — `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `X | None`. Never `List`, `Dict`, `Tuple`, `Optional`, `Union` from `typing`.
- **Import grouping** (in this order, blank line between groups):
  1. Built-in modules
  2. Third-party packages
  3. `kohakuterrarium.*` modules
- **Within each group**: `import` statements before `from` imports, shorter dotted paths first, then alphabetical.
- **No imports inside functions.** The only exceptions are optional dependencies and lazy imports specifically used to avoid long startup time. Circular-import workarounds are not an excuse — restructure instead.
- **No naive `print()` in library code.** Use the structured logger (built on `stdlib logging`, not loguru). Format `[HH:MM:SS] [module.name] [LEVEL] message`. Avoid reserved `LogRecord` attribute names in `extra=` kwargs (`name`, `msg`, `args`, `levelname`, `module`, `lineno`, etc. — full list in CLAUDE.md).
- **Max 600 lines per file** (hard cap 1000, enforced by `tests/unit/test_file_sizes.py`). Split modules before they grow.
- **Full asyncio.** Mark sync modules as "requires blocking" or "can be `to_thread`".
- **Prefer `match-case`** over deeply nested `if-elif-else`.
- **Never use `sys.path` hacks** in examples or tests. Always import from the installed package.

### Frontend

The Vue 3 frontend lives in [`src/kohakuterrarium-frontend/`](src/kohakuterrarium-frontend/). It is JavaScript only — **no TypeScript**. Run `npm run format:check` and `npm run build` before pushing.

### Architecture rules

These are the rules that get most-violated by drive-by PRs. Read CLAUDE.md "Core Architecture Concepts" in full before touching anything in `core/`, `terrarium/`, or `modules/subagent/`.

- **Creature** — self-contained agent. Has its own LLM, tools, sub-agents, memory, I/O. Does **not** know it is in a terrarium.
- **Terrarium** — pure wiring. **No LLM, no intelligence, no decisions.** Loads creatures, creates channels, manages lifecycle.
- **Root agent** — a creature that sits **outside** the terrarium and manages it via tools. **Never** a peer of creatures inside.
- **Sub-agents inside a creature** are vertical (private internal delegation). **Creatures connected by a terrarium** are horizontal (peer, opaque). Never mix the two compositions.
- **Controller is an orchestrator.** Its outputs should be short — tool calls, sub-agent dispatches, status updates. Long user-facing content comes from output sub-agents.
- **Tool execution is async, non-blocking, parallel.** Start tools the moment `##tool##` is detected during streaming. Never queue them, never run sequentially, never block LLM output to wait for them.

### Post-implementation checklist

Before opening the PR:

1. Re-read your diff against CLAUDE.md rules. Especially in-function imports, `print()` calls, and the import order.
2. Run `black src/ tests/` and `ruff check src/ tests/`.
3. Add tests in the right tier. New behaviour gets a `tests/unit/` test that pins it; if you touched a core-lib folder or a user journey, extend that folder's `tests/integration/` workflow or the relevant `tests/e2e/` journey rather than adding a new test function. See [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md) for the tier conventions. Test suites can use simpler output than library code.
4. Split commits along logical boundaries — one concept per commit, working on each commit.
5. Fill out the PR template completely.
6. If this is a feature PR, verify that the linked issue/discussion existed before the PR and that the approval is explicit.
7. If you skipped any local check, explain that in the PR body instead of leaving reviewers guessing.

## Adding Things

We removed the inline code snippets from this document on purpose — they drift from reality every release. Use the existing implementations as the source of truth:

- **A built-in tool** — read [`src/kohakuterrarium/builtins/tools/README.md`](src/kohakuterrarium/builtins/tools/README.md) and copy the pattern from a small existing tool such as `glob.py` or `grep.py`. Add the matching skill doc under [`src/kohakuterrarium/builtin_skills/tools/`](src/kohakuterrarium/builtin_skills/tools/).
- **A built-in sub-agent** — read [`src/kohakuterrarium/builtins/subagents/README.md`](src/kohakuterrarium/builtins/subagents/README.md) and use an existing config such as `explore.py` or `research.py` as the template. Add the matching skill doc under [`src/kohakuterrarium/builtin_skills/subagents/`](src/kohakuterrarium/builtin_skills/subagents/).
- **An LLM preset** — see `src/kohakuterrarium/llm/presets.py` for the dict shape, or use `kt config llm add` to register a user preset.
- **An example agent or terrarium** — copy an existing folder under `examples/agent-apps/` or `examples/terrariums/` and adapt the config + system prompt.
- **A package (shareable creature/terrarium bundle)** — see the package system documented under `kt install --help` and `kt info`.

Any of these still counts as a feature contribution and falls under the **Feature PRs require prior approval** rule above. Open the issue first.

## Reporting Issues

Use the templates in [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/). Include:

- Python version, OS, install method (`uv pip install -e .` vs wheel vs other)
- For agent-behavior issues: the exact creature/terrarium config and a minimal reproducible scenario
- Relevant logs (the structured logger output, not just stdout)
- For frontend issues: browser, console errors, and what the API/WS traffic looked like

Search existing issues first — the duplicate rate is high.
