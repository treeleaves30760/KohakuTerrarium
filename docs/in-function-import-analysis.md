In-Function Import Analysis
===========================

Current state of in-function imports in `src/kohakuterrarium/`.
Updated 2026-04-02 after the structural refactoring.

Previous audit (2026-04-01) found 32 runtime in-function imports. The
refactoring eliminated all but 2 of them. The old import cycle involving
`builtins.tools -> terrarium.runtime -> core.agent` is gone, replaced
by `tool_catalog` (a leaf module) with deferred loaders.


========================================================================
1. Remaining In-Function Imports (2 total)
========================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1a. core/__init__.py:100 -- core.agent.Agent, run_agent
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Pattern: Module-level __getattr__ lazy loading.
  Import:  from kohakuterrarium.core.agent import Agent, run_agent

  Why: core/__init__.py eagerly imports core.controller, core.config,
  and other core submodules. core.agent transitively imports
  builtins.inputs (via bootstrap), which would cause a partial-
  initialization error if Agent were imported at module level in
  __init__.py.

  The lazy __getattr__ approach has zero runtime cost for normal code
  paths, since all production code imports Agent directly from
  core.agent, not from core/__init__.

  Verdict: LEGITIMATE lazy load to avoid init-order issue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1b. terrarium/tool_registration.py:24 -- builtins.tools.terrarium_tools
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Function: ensure_terrarium_tools_registered()
  Import:  import kohakuterrarium.builtins.tools.terrarium_tools

  Why: terrarium_tools uses @register_builtin decorators from
  tool_catalog. If tool_registration.py imported terrarium_tools at
  top level, the module would execute decorator calls during import,
  which must be deferred until the catalog is ready and the caller
  actually needs terrarium tools.

  This module registers itself as a deferred loader with tool_catalog
  via register_deferred_loader(). On first catalog miss, the loader
  triggers the import, which runs the decorators and populates the
  catalog. Subsequent lookups hit the cache directly.

  Verdict: LEGITIMATE deferred registration pattern.


========================================================================
2. What Was Eliminated
========================================================================

The refactoring removed 30 in-function imports across these categories:

  a) stdlib/core-dependency imports that had no circular justification
     (asyncio, json, yaml, select, sys, openai, parsing.format,
     llm.tools, llm.message, core.environment)

  b) stale circular-avoidance imports where the original cycle had
     already been broken by earlier refactoring (core/agent_init.py
     imports of modules.subagent, builtins.subagents, parsing.format)

  c) the builtins.tools.registry._ensure_terrarium_tools() mechanism,
     replaced by tool_catalog deferred loaders and the dedicated
     terrarium/tool_registration.py module

  d) terrarium/runtime.py in-function import of builtins.tools.registry,
     replaced by direct import of builtins.tool_catalog.get_builtin_tool
     in the new terrarium/factory.py

  e) core/config.py yaml/json/tomllib imports moved to top level
     (tomllib/tomli try/except kept at module level)

  f) optional-dependency imports in builtins/inputs/whisper.py moved to
     module top level (the module is already guarded by try/except in
     builtins/inputs/__init__.py)


========================================================================
3. Import Cycle Status
========================================================================

The largest strongly connected component (SCC) that previously involved
builtins.tools, core.agent, and terrarium.runtime is fully broken:

  Old path:
    builtins.tools.registry -> builtins.tools.terrarium_tools
      -> terrarium.runtime -> core.agent -> core.agent_init
      -> builtins.tools.registry

  Current state:
    - tool_catalog is a leaf module (no internal imports beyond utils.logging)
    - terrarium/factory.py imports tool_catalog directly (no cycle)
    - terrarium/tool_registration.py registers a deferred loader with
      tool_catalog, only importing terrarium_tools on demand

Two minor bidirectional dependencies remain (unchanged, both use
in-function imports placed inside convenience functions):

  Chain 1:
    core/session.py -> core/scratchpad.Scratchpad
    core/scratchpad.py -> (in-function) core/session.get_session

  Chain 2:
    core/session.py -> core/channel.ChannelRegistry
    core/channel.py -> (in-function) core/session.get_session

These are stable and low-cost. The convenience functions (get_scratchpad,
get_channel_registry) could be moved to session.py to eliminate the
cycles, but this is low priority.


========================================================================
4. TYPE_CHECKING and Other Non-Runtime Imports
========================================================================

TYPE_CHECKING blocks and docstring examples are not counted above.
These are standard patterns and require no action. Notable
TYPE_CHECKING guards:

  - core/agent.py: Environment
  - core/controller.py: ToolSchema
  - core/events.py: ContentPart, TextPart
  - builtins/tool_catalog.py: BaseTool
  - terrarium/api.py: ChannelObserver, TerrariumRuntime
  - terrarium/factory.py: TerrariumRuntime
  - terrarium/persistence.py: TerrariumRuntime
  - modules/tool/base.py: ContentPart, ImagePart, TextPart
  - prompt/plugins.py: Registry
