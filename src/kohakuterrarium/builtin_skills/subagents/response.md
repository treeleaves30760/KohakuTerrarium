# response

Output sub-agent for generating user-facing responses.

## WHEN TO USE

- Controller wants to delegate response generation
- Need longer, more detailed output
- Separating orchestration from output generation
- Response needs specific formatting or style

## WHEN NOT TO USE

- Simple, short responses
- Controller can respond directly
- Internal processing/decisions

## HOW TO USE

```
[/response]
what to communicate
[response/]
```

## Arguments

| Arg | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| body | content | What to communicate to the user |

## OUTPUT ROUTING

The response sub-agent is an **output sub-agent**:
- `output_to: external` - Output streams directly to user
- Does NOT return to controller
- Designed for user-facing content

## CAPABILITIES

The response sub-agent:
- Receives context from controller
- Generates formatted responses
- Can maintain character/style consistency
- Streams output directly to user

## USE CASES

1. **RP Agent**: Generate in-character dialogue
2. **Assistant**: Format detailed explanations
3. **Report Generation**: Create structured output

## LIMITATIONS

- Output-only (cannot use tools)
- Cannot interact with controller after starting
- Single-turn output generation
