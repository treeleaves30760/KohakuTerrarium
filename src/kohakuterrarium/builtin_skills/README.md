# builtin_skills/

Default documentation files for builtin tools and sub-agents, shipped with
the framework. Each markdown file provides full usage documentation that is
loaded on demand via the `##info##` command or the `info` tool. Users can
override any file by placing a same-named file in their agent's
`prompts/tools/` or `prompts/subagents/` folder.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|

| `tools/*.md` | One markdown doc per builtin tool (bash, read, edit, write, glob, grep, etc.) |
| `subagents/*.md` | One markdown doc per builtin sub-agent (explore, plan, worker, critic, etc.) |
