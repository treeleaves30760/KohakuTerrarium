# glob

Find files by glob pattern, sorted by modification time (newest first).

## WHEN TO USE

- Finding files by name or extension
- Exploring project structure
- Locating specific file types

## HOW TO USE

```
tool call: glob(
pattern
)
```

Or with optional parameters:

```
tool call: glob(
  path: base_dir
  limit: 50
pattern
)
```

## Arguments

| Arg | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| pattern | body | Glob pattern (required) |
| path | @@arg | Base directory (default: cwd) |
| limit | @@arg | Max results (default: 100) |

## Pattern Syntax

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `*` | Any chars except `/` |
| `**` | Any chars including `/` (recursive) |
| `?` | Single character |
| `[abc]` | a, b, or c |

## Examples

```
tool call: glob(
**/*.py
)
```

```
tool call: glob(
  path: src/components
*.ts
)
```

```
tool call: glob(
**/*.{json,yaml,toml}
)
```

## Output Format

```
src/main.py
src/utils/helpers.py
tests/test_main.py
```

Results are sorted by modification time (newest first). Shows total count when results are truncated by the limit.

## TIPS

- Use `**/*.ext` for recursive search by extension
- Combine with `read` to examine found files
- Use specific patterns to narrow results in large codebases
