    """Teach prompt_toolkit to decode the escape sequences that terminals
    emit once enhanced keyboard reporting is enabled.

    ``runtime.enable_enhanced_keyboard`` asks the terminal to switch to
    xterm ``modifyOtherKeys=2`` **and** Kitty keyboard protocol flag 1
    ("Disambiguate escape codes"). Under either protocol, keys that used
    to arrive as single-byte control codes (``\\x04`` for Ctrl+D, ``\\r``
    for Enter, …) now arrive as escape sequences prompt_toolkit's
    built-in table has no mapping for — so every ``@kb.add("c-d")``,
    ``@kb.add("enter")`` etc. silently stops firing and the raw bytes
    leak into the buffer.

    We patch ``ANSI_SEQUENCES`` so those forms decode to the same
    ``Keys.Control*`` values as the classic single-byte encoding,
    keeping every existing key binding intact.

    Coverage:

    - **Ctrl+a..z** (modifier = ``5``) under both encodings:

      - Kitty CSI u:        ``ESC [ <codepoint> ; 5 u``
      - modifyOtherKeys=2:  ``ESC [ 27 ; 5 ; <codepoint> ~``

      where ``<codepoint>`` is the lowercase ASCII value (97..122).

    - **Esc / Enter / Tab / Backspace** under Kitty CSI u — some
      terminals disambiguate these even without modifiers:

      - Esc       → ``ESC [ 27 u``   → ``Keys.Escape``
      - Enter     → ``ESC [ 13 u``   → ``Keys.ControlM``
      - Tab       → ``ESC [ 9 u``    → ``Keys.ControlI``
      - Backspace → ``ESC [ 127 u``  → ``Keys.ControlH``

    - **Modifier + Enter** (proxied through F19/F20/F21 so our key
      bindings can treat them as "insert newline"):

      - Kitty CSI u:       ``ESC [ 13 ; <mods> u``
      - modifyOtherKeys=2: ``ESC [ 27 ; <mods> ; 13 ~``

      ``mods`` values: 2 = shift, 5 = ctrl, 6 = ctrl+shift.

    Out of scope (deliberately not registered): Alt+letter, Ctrl+Shift+
    letter, and Cmd/Super+letter. prompt_toolkit has no enum slots for
    most of them, they conflict with classic encodings, and users rarely
    bind those combos in this app. Adding them later is a drop-in.

    Idempotent — guarded by a module-level flag so re-importing this
    module (e.g. inside tests) doesn't repeatedly mutate the global
    ``ANSI_SEQUENCES`` table.
