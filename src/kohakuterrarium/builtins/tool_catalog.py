"""
Builtin tool catalog: pure lookup and registration.

This is a leaf module with zero side effects. It holds the global
registry dict and provides lookup/factory functions. Individual tool
modules use ``@register_builtin`` to register themselves at import
time, but this module never imports any tool module itself.

Supports **deferred loaders**: callables registered via
``register_deferred_loader`` that are invoked on first cache miss.
This lets the terrarium layer register its tools lazily without
the catalog knowing anything about terrarium internals.

Internal code (core, terrarium) should import from here, not from
``builtins.tools``, to avoid pulling in all tool modules and their
transitive dependencies.
