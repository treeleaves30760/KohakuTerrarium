"""Shared stub for codegen kinds whose full implementation lands in Phase 3.

Phase 1 exposes just enough for the read-only route to work: a
``parse_back`` that returns raw-mode envelope with a warning, and
``render_new``/``update_existing`` that simply pass source through
(valid raw-mode behavior — no round-trip attempt).

Per-kind modules re-export these via ``from ._pending_stub import *``
and override as implementation matures.
