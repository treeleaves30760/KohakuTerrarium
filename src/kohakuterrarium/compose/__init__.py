"""Agent Composition Algebra — Pythonic operators for combining agents.

Usage::

    from kohakuterrarium.compose import agent, factory, Pure

    # Persistent agent (reused across calls)
    async with await agent("@kt-defaults/creatures/swe") as swe:
        result = await (swe >> extract_code >> reviewer)(task)

    # Ephemeral agent (fresh per call)
    specialist = factory(make_config("coder"))
    result = await specialist("implement this feature")

    # Operators: >> (sequence), & (parallel), | (fallback), * (retry)
    pipeline = (expert * 2) | generalist
    results = await (analyst & writer & designer)(task)

    # Iterate (loop with native control flow)
    async for result in (writer >> reviewer).iterate(task):
        if "APPROVED" in result:
            break
