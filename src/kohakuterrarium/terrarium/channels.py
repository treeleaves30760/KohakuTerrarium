"""Channel layer for the Terrarium engine.

Bridges the pure-data topology (``terrarium.topology``) and the live
``Environment.shared_channels`` registry from ``core.channel``.  Owns
channel injection — when a creature joins a graph that has channels it
listens to, a :class:`ChannelTrigger` is added to its
``trigger_manager``.

Supports both static wiring (declared at recipe-load time) and live
hot-plug (creatures connecting after they're already running).

The ``connect_creatures`` / ``disconnect_creatures`` helpers below are
the bodies of ``Terrarium.connect`` / ``Terrarium.disconnect``;
they're kept here to keep ``engine.py`` under the 600-line cap and
because every line of logic in them is channel-related.
