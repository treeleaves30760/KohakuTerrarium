"""Caller resolution for the group_* tool surface.

Group tools take no graph_id / creature_id self-reference — the caller
is implicit (it's whoever's running the tool). This module turns the
generic :class:`ToolContext` into a :class:`GroupContext` carrying:

- the live :class:`Terrarium` engine,
- the calling :class:`Creature`,
- its current graph topology,

and computes the caller's *group* (caller's graph members ∪ caller's
spawned children regardless of which graph they are currently in).
