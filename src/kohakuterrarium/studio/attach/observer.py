"""Channel observer attach — engine-backed.

Replaces ``KohakuManager.terrarium_channel_stream`` and
``agent_channel_stream``.  Streams channel messages observed in a
session's environment as ``ChannelEvent`` objects.

Body adapted verbatim from
``serving/manager.py:_stream_from_registry`` (the legacy implementation
that already worked over either a shared or private ``ChannelRegistry``).
The only behaviour change is the resolution path: instead of
``manager._get_runtime(...).environment.shared_channels`` we use
``engine._environments[session_id].shared_channels``.
