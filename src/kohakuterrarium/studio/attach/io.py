"""Single IO attach — engine-backed bidirectional chat.

Replaces the legacy ``ws/agents.py``, ``ws/chat.py:ws_terrarium``,
``ws/chat.py:ws_creature``, plus
``serving/agent_session.py:StreamOutput`` and the helper trio
``_attach_terrarium_outputs / _register_channel_callbacks /
_send_channel_history`` in ``ws/chat.py``.

The new attach mounts onto a creature via ``engine.get_creature(cid)``
and translates the engine's ``OutputModule`` events to the WS frame
schema the frontend already speaks.  When the creature lives in a
multi-creature graph, the same WS connection also surfaces shared-
channel messages and history (the legacy "terrarium WS" behaviour),
so the frontend chat panel works the same in both 1- and N-creature
sessions.
