"""Attach policies — per-creature / per-graph stream advertisement.

The Studio UI asks the backend "what live streams does this creature /
graph support?" so it can hide attach toggles that would 1011 close
anyway. This module is the canonical answer.

Four policies are defined (per ``plan.md §3.6``):

- ``IO`` — bidirectional chat (controller stream + user input).
  Available only for creatures with a configured input module.
- ``LOG`` — process log tail. Always available (engine-independent).
- ``OBSERVER`` — non-destructive channel observation.
  Available for graphs (terrariums) and for creatures attached to a
  graph; not for standalone creatures with no channels.
- ``TRACE`` — live append-only event stream from the session store.
  Available whenever a session is in-process (resumed live).

The advertisement helpers return a list because a creature can support
multiple policies simultaneously (e.g. a terrarium-attached creature
exposes IO + LOG + OBSERVER + TRACE all at once).
