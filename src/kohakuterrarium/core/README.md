# core/ (Runtime and Orchestration)

The core module contains the runtime engine that powers every KohakuTerrarium agent.
All components communicate through a unified `TriggerEvent` model.

## Modules

### Agent (`agent.py`, `agent_init.py`, `agent_handlers.py`)

Top-level orchestrator that wires all subsystems together. Split across three files
to stay under the line limit:

- **`agent.py`**: `Agent` class with public API (`from_path()`, `run()`, `inject_input()`)
- **`agent_init.py`**: `AgentInitMixin` initializes LLM, registry, executor, input, output, triggers, sub-agents
- **`agent_handlers.py`**: `AgentHandlersMixin` processes events, executes tools, manages background jobs

### Controller (`controller.py`)

Main LLM conversation loop. Receives `TriggerEvent`s, maintains conversation
context, runs the LLM, and parses output into tool calls, sub-agent dispatches,
commands, and text. Supports multimodal content (text + images).

Key class: `ControllerConfig` (model, temperature, ephemeral mode, context limits).

### Executor (`executor.py`)

Background tool runner. Starts tools via `asyncio.create_task()` during LLM
streaming so they run in parallel. Tracks jobs and produces completion events.

### Events (`events.py`)

Unified event model. `TriggerEvent` is the single event type that flows through
the entire system. Inputs, triggers, tool completions, and sub-agent outputs
all produce `TriggerEvent`s. Supports stackable batching and multimodal content.

Common event types: `user_input`, `timer`, `tool_complete`, `subagent_output`,
`monitor`, `error`.

### Channel (`channel.py`)

Named async pub/sub channels for cross-component communication. Components send
and receive `ChannelMessage`s through a `ChannelRegistry` without direct coupling.
Used by `send_message`/`wait_channel` tools and `ChannelTrigger`.

### Session (`session.py`)

Keyed shared state registry. A `Session` holds all session-scoped objects for one
agent (or a group of cooperating agents): channels, scratchpad, TUI state, and
user-provided extras. Functions: `get_session(key)`, `set_session()`, `remove_session()`.
Agents with the same `session_key` in config share a single Session instance.

The legacy `get_channel_registry()` and `get_scratchpad()` singletons now route
through the default session for backward compatibility.

### Scratchpad (`scratchpad.py`)

Session-scoped key-value working memory. Unlike file-based memory (cross-session,
agent-managed), the scratchpad is cleared on restart, framework-managed, structured,
and cheap (no LLM needed to read/write).

### Termination (`termination.py`)

Configurable stop conditions for the agent loop. Supports: `max_turns`,
`max_tokens`, `max_duration`, `idle_timeout`, and `keywords` (stop on output
keyword). Any triggered condition stops the agent.

### Config (`config.py`)

Loads and validates agent configuration from YAML, JSON, or TOML files.
Supports environment variable interpolation (`${VAR:default}`). Produces
`AgentConfig` with typed sub-configs for input, tools, triggers, sub-agents,
output, and termination.

### Constants (`constants.py`)

Framework-wide magic numbers: tool result truncation limits, status preview
lengths, and sub-agent output caps.

### Environment (`environment.py`)

Isolated execution context for multi-session support. An `Environment` holds
shared state per user request (inter-creature channels, config overrides),
while `Session` holds private state per creature.

### TriggerManager (`trigger_manager.py`)

Centralized trigger lifecycle management. Owns all trigger instances and their
async tasks, providing the event loop for each trigger. Tools can add and
remove triggers at runtime via the agent's trigger_manager.

### Supporting Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `conversation.py` | Context management and compaction |
| `job.py` | Job status tracking (`JobStore`, `JobResult`, `JobState`) |
| `loader.py` | Dynamic module loading (custom tools, inputs, outputs) |
| `registry.py` | Module registration (`Registry` for tools and sub-agents) |
